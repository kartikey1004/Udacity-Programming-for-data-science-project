### Project Title
Udacity-programming-for-Data-Science-using-Python-Nanodegree
Created Kartikey Umare
This repository contains the Python project for Udacity Programming For Data Science Using Python Nanodegree.

### Description
Overview
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Project Submission
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

Working
This program is structured in 2 steps.
In the first moment, the user selects the filters that are going to be applied to the database. The user is able to choose as many filters as it would like.
After this step, the DataFrame for the analysis is created based on the filters chosen by the user.
In the second moment, the user is able to choose, from a list of options, the statistics the user would like to calculate, based on the available filtered data.

### Files used
The required files for running this program are:

washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv
